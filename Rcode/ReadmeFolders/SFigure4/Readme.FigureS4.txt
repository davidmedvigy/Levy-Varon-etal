SFigure4.R contains the R code used to create supplemental figure 4. Figure 4 shows results from the Fixer and Null Fixer Simulations.  

To run this code, you will need the Results.csv file described in the "Extract results needed to make figures" folder.

Note that you will have to change 
1) the working directory in the first line of the code to identify where the Results.csv file is located. 
2) the file pathway to designate where the figure image will be written to.  This occurs on line that starts with "postscript" in the section before before plot a is created.
